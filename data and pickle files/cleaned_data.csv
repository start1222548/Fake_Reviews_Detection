26,5,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular my skin feels dry. As busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself have bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all time.. however by day 3 I actually liked smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up.

It's main selling point, beyond being an effective 24 hour deodorant, is that it is not prone to marking your clothes.

I have also tried using this cream during daytime and, while it has all benefits described above, it\u2019s not long-lasting enough in terms of hydration it gives, meaning you often feel need to reapply after few hours.

Sometimes you can get alcohol fatigue so Bovril is great alternative to nightcap or even mug of tea.

But this product trial gave me perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself have bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit first time I put this on I wasn't sure about smell. It's not offensive it's like cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all time.. however by day 3 I actually liked smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up.

Just don't go sniffing directly from bottle as it's concentrated, scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for much smaller bottle you don't need to use as much in washing machine either (just half lid worth); smaller bottle of course makes carbon footprint smaller; in addition, bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is bonus, both bottle lid can be recycled back. Only downside is sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing bottle in recycling; hopefully they will work on making whole thing recyclable in future.

We tend to alternate between Fairy Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all time because some members of family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on children's clothes because it leaves them nice soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by British Skin Foundation. Price for kit at time of writing review is Â£11, this is slightly more than you would currently get individual products in some supermarkets (Â£3 for each product).

I found I needed to use jar opener to remove lid for first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via post as it means there is less chance of lid coming loose spilling contents into parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like scent, which transfers well to laundry leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in shop before committing to large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyoneÂs taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff.

I also LOVE Tescos gluten dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts chocolate, cone is thick crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide awful taste of ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed flavour from. I enjoyed eating chocolate nut part cone, just cringed my way through ice cream part. Cant understand all rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on delicious!!!",False,157,853
